# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Customer-Reviews
This project would develop machine learning models to analyze customer reviews and classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The project would implement multiple classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, LSTM, BERT) to compare their effectiveness.

Key Components:

Text preprocessing including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal 
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings 
Implementation of traditional ML models and deep learning approaches 
Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves
Analysis of misclassifications and model limitations
Applications in real-time brand monitoring and customer service prioritization
